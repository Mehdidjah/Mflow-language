## Implementation Examples

### HTML Usage

```html
<!-- Inline SVG with gradient -->
<svg width="64" height="64" viewBox="0 0 64 64">
  <defs>
    <linearGradient id="mflow-gradient" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="100%">
      <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#00FFFF"/>
      <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#FF00FF"/>
    </linearGradient>
  </defs>
  <path fill="url(#mflow-gradient)" d="M... (M shape path)" />
</svg>
```

### CSS Styling

```css
.mflow-logo {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #00FFFF 0%, #FF00FF 100%);
